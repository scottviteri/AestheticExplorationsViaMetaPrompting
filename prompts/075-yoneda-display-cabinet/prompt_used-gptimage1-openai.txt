A museum cabinet with a single central artifact—an abstract stone form—and a ring of smaller alcoves around it showing how different "visitors" interact with it: gloves of various materials touch, rods measure, mirrors sample; each alcove displays the central form only through its interactions. The middle artifact remains constant. Walnut, linen, glass; oculus light; quiet, precise., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
