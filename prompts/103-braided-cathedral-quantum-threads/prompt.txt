Within a dark nave, thin opaline threads hang from the vaults and braid around copper pillars before rejoining near the altar. Certain crossings are guided by small glass hooks; others pass freely, and the pattern records a story in its over/under sequence. Candles breathe; the braid slowly untwists and rebraids, preserving its quiet invariants. Indigo, brass, devotional.
