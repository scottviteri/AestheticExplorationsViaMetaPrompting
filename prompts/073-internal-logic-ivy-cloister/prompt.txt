Within a vine-draped cloister, engraved stone tablets line two arcades. On one side, tablets pair naturallyâ€”ivy tendrils trace adjunction-like correspondences; on the other, tablet pairs are mirrored by thin bronze frames that realign sentences into equivalent shapes. A central fountain reflects both sides in one image. Soft morning light; mossy stone; gentle symmetry; no text, only form.
