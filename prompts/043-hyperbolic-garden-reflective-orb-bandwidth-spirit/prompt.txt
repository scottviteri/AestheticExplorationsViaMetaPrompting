A moonlit courtyard garden where ivy and climbing vines are glassy fiber strands carrying pulses of blue-white light, branching along trellises shaped like gentle brackets. At the center, a still tiled fountain holds a floating polished chrome sphere; the orb mirrors the luminous vines and its own reflection, a serene fixed point. Fireflies drift like tiny packets, leaving dotted trails. Faint circuit motifs are etched into the stone path, glowing softly underfoot, as if an operating system for the place. Low fog hugs the ground; lanterns hang from archways, their halos overlapping. Color palette of midnight blue, silver, and pale jade; wide-angle 28mm, low vantage, shallow depth, cinematic bloom.
