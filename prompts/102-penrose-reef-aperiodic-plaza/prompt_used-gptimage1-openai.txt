A shallow plaza under water; paving stones are Penrose rhombi in bronze and pale stone, drifting sea-grass outlining thick/thin kite seams. Bioluminescent algae pick out local stars and suns in the pattern; a slow parallax reveals no repeating patch. Schools of small fish thread along matching rules, turning as if by whispered law. Turquoise dusk, sacred quiet., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
