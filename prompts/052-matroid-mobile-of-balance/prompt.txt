A suspended mobile of brass rods and rings over a black marble plinth. Some triples of rings snap into rigid triangular modules (circuits); other combinations swing freely, achieving a graceful global equilibrium. Clean shadows on the wall reveal which sets constrain motion. Quiet gallery lighting.
