A tranquil koi garden whose stepping stones are arranged as a Sierpi≈Ñski triangle: triangular void pools reflect lanterns while remaining stones carry moss and water beads. Overhead, a trellis casts matching self-similar shadows; koi glide through the triangular inlets. Warm wood, stone, water, lantern light.
