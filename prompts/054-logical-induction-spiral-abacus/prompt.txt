A spiral abacus rises like a helical column from a black basalt plinth. Beads of pearl, smoky quartz, and jade brighten as they circle outward, settling from erratic inner rings to stable outer bands. Thin copper rails guide each orbit; tiny brass detents suggest cycles without text. Studio lighting with crisp shadows; shallow depth of field on bead textures; centered composition.
