A daylight workshop under a tall skylight. Two stone benches face each other: one marked by a ribbon of copper inlay (possible tasks), the other edged with dark iron (impossible tasks). On the copper bench, modular joints, gears, glass arcs, and timber segments click together cleanly into elegant assemblies; on the iron bench, a few partly-built forms arrest mid-join, clearly unable to meet. Chalk diagrams annotate only geometry, not text. Dust motes; warm wood, cool slate, crisp highlights., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
