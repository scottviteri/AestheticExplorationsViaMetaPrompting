A loom altar of dark walnut and brass where two processes interleave: on the left, lantern-threads split cleanly into two (coproduct-like), and on the right, two threads join into a brighter single line (product-like). In the center, a polished crystal plaque shows the compatibility pattern as a woven motif. Warm workshop light; macro detail on heddles and shuttles.
