Inside a candlelit choir alcove, a carved walnut lectern holds an open illuminated music folio. The gilded initial on the page curls like a lambda; within it, a tiny painting of this very alcove repeats the scene once. A thin border of little serpents biting their tails encircles the page. Behind the stand, a polished obsidian mirror faintly echoes the book and candles. A small baroque violin rests with its bow; a quill, an hourglass, and a wax seal sit on the ledge. Beeswax candles and hanging brass lamps cast warm light; incense smoke rises in a gentle loop. Stone ribs and a pointed arch frame the nook. Opaline highlights on gold leaf, abalone inlay glinting; dust motes in the glow. No legible text. Soft, reverent, high detail, shallow depth of field., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
