A night garden where technology blooms: arching trellises of clear glass vines weave above a stone path, their translucent veins carrying streams of light like fireflies in formationâ€”visible bandwidth flowing. At the center, a low altar of stacked crystalline slabs, each one etched with branching patterns that echo smaller within, a humble fractal shrine. Dew beads sparkle, a moth with opaline wings rests on a glowing tendril, and tiny chimes shaped like nodes sway in a breeze, ringing softly. Indigo sky, silver stars, bioluminescent blues and golds, gentle fog near the ground. Tranquil, sacred, and precise; wide-angle, symmetrical framing, ultra-detailed textures; no text, no watermark.
