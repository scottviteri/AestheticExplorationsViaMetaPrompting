A cathedral-like scriptorium at dusk; a walnut altar-desk holds an open illuminated manuscript about biology. On vellum pages: painted botanical leaves, honeycomb and cell-division rosettes rendered as jewel-toned miniatures (no legible text, only ornamental glyphs). Three crystal magnifiers and a brass microscope shaped like a reliquary catch shafts of stained-glass light. Thin crimson silk ribbons trace gentle paths across margins like careful edits and guidance, pinched by tiny gold clips; translucent wax seals with check and cross motifs rest beside a stack of bound journals with blank spines. Scattered petri dishes of colored glass glow like small windows, projecting circular reflections. Dust motes float in volumetric light from a high clerestory. Compose as a quiet altar to clarity and revision, symmetrical, intimate 35mm, f/2.8 shallow depth, warm gold and cool teal palette, soft bokeh., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
