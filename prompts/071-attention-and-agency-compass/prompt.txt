On a basalt plinth, a polished brass compass whose needle is a beam of light sweeping an etched rose. Around it, small mirrored paddles on springs turn towards the light when it dwells, and relax when it moves, forming a visible attention field. A single articulated arm acts when the light holds steady long enough, nudging a glass bead along a trackâ€”attention shaping action. Deep blacks, crisp speculars, macro detail.
