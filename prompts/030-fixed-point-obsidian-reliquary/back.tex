Photoreal macro still-life of a Fixed-Point Reliquary: a hand-sized monolith carved from polished obsidian, edges razor-crisp, centered as the single hero subject. A rectangular portal is cut through its face and lined with thin opal inlay that emits a quiet cyan–teal glow. Inside, a perfectly scaled replica of the same monolith sits within, repeating physically five layers deep, each nested and aligned to suggest a self-referential fixed point; beyond those, opposing semi-silvered opaline glass panes extend the recursion into a soft mirrors-within-mirrors infinity without revealing any camera. The reliquary rests on a low basalt plinth. Cathedral side-light from the left paints gold-edged rim highlights on the obsidian and catches a subtle volumetric fog that drifts in a slow, breath-like spiral through the portal. Background falls to deep indigo-black negative space. Surfaces show micro-scratches and faint fingerprints on the stone; the opal veins shimmer with iridescent blues and pale fire. Optional: a tiny, incidental goldleaf Y inlay on the plinth, barely perceptible. Keep composition clean and symmetrical, devotional mood, no readable text. Palette: Obsidian–Opal with gentle indigo accents. Lighting: left-side cathedral beam, soft right fill, faint top rim. Avoid clutter and global complex geometry; render as a calm, sacred threshold made recursive.
