An archipelago under night skies: each island holds a small obsidian lighthouse with a lettered lantern. Beams arc between islands like accessibility relations, sometimes one-way, sometimes bidirectional. When a bell tolls, certain lights must be on wherever the beam reaches (necessity); elsewhere, a single wink is permitted (possibility). Starfields reflect in still water; quiet modal music.
