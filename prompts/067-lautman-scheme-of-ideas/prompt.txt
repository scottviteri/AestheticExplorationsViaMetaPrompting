A study lined with glass vitrines. Inside each, a sculptural pair of opposites—smooth/rough, continuous/discrete, rigid/fluid—sit in tension yet harmonize through a third mediating element (a hinge, a filigree, a shared base). A ceiling oculus unifies them in one light pool, hinting at a meta-structure. Walnut, brass, stone, water; contemplative metaphysics made tangible.
