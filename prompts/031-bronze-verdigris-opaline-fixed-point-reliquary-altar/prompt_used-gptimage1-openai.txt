Macro still-life of a fixed-point reliquary: a palm-sized bronze altar housing an opaline glass portal that contains a physically scaled miniature of the reliquary itself, seen between two facing half-silvered opaline mirrors to create a calm, infinite regress. The bronze frame is simple yet sacral, with quiet Y-shaped internal struts and soft verdigris in the recesses; edges are lightly kissed with goldleaf. The reliquary sits centered on a polished obsidian slab veined with faint opal fire. Lighting is cathedral side-light from high left, rim highlights tracing bronze contours, a gentle inner glow within the portal, and faint volumetric dust motes in the beam. Inside the recursion, the miniature reliquary repeats and dwindles toward a single luminous point at exact center—a visual fixed point. A thin breath-like mist spiral loops through the portal and back around the frame, understated and translucent. Background is deep indigo-black with generous negative space and soft studio falloff; shallow depth-of-field keeps the reliquary crisp and the backdrop velvety. Palette: Copper–Verdigris with Obsidian–Opal accents; goldleaf restrained. Subtle opaline caustics play on the glass, supporting the sense of recursion. No readable text, labels, or figures; no camera reflections—one centered, tangible hero subject, serene and renderable., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
