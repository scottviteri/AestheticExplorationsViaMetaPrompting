A circular aviary at dusk, glass and bronze. Lantern-birds perch on flexible reeds that sway with a faint, chaotic breeze. Over time, the flock collectively adjusts: perches re-angle, small wind vanes pivot, and the lanterns settle into a configuration that dampens the motion, reducing surprise in the system. Soft amber-blue palette; incense haze; macro detail on reed joints and tiny vane bearings; serene, observational mood.
