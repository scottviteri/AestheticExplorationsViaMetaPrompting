A dusky sphere floats over black water; thin bands of light trace countless tiny circles that interlock without touching, each circle a soft lantern ring riding the surface and the air just above it. As the sphere turns, rings lift away, weave past one another, and settle back, their reflections knitting a second lattice on the pool below. Indigo, opaline glass, devotional quiet; linkedness made serene.
