Photoreal sculpture still of a sacral guidance ring: a verdigris bronze torus with a soft deltoid profile, hovering a finger’s breadth above a matte obsidian plinth. Along the torus’ outer rim, fine heat-sink-like fins are carved in an even radial array (subtle GPU-optimization motif). Its inner rim is lined with opaline mirror facets stepped in discrete levels, reading as quantization; several evenly spaced spokes that would tie the ring to a central hub are purposefully absent, leaving clean mortise notches that suggest pruning. Suspended inside on three slender bronze gimbals is a smaller, simplified copy of the ring—same materials, fewer facets and no fins—an elegant distillation. At the exact center, a polished obsidian bead hangs on an invisible filament, acting as a fixed point that repeats in the facing mirrors as an infinite, receding string of beads; the bead appears unwavering even as reflections circle away, evoking strange loop guidance and patient learning. A faint curl of incense smoke drifts through the aperture, catching light but remaining secondary. Lighting: a warm, soft key from upper left creates deep, slow speculars on bronze and milky bloom on the opaline facets; a cooler rim light from the right edges the rings; gentle volumetric haze reveals a subtle halo within the torus. Composition: three-quarter view, the outer ring centered and slightly tilted forward, the inner ring nested and clearly visible; moderate depth of field keeps both rings and the central bead crisp while the charcoal background falls to soft gradient. No text or labels in frame; materials read clearly with micro-scratches on bronze, slight verdigris in crevices, and a delicate opaline caustic reflected onto the plinth.
