Low-key still life on a dark walnut altar table: a sleek black EEG headset rests on a sculpted mannequin head, encircled by arcs of glass fiber-optic strands that loop into a tidy ring and cascade into small hand-blown bulbs. The fibers pulse from cool cyan near the head to warm amber at the bulbs, like information flowing outward. Two brass candlesticks, a simple stone bowl with polished copper coil, symmetrical arrangement. Smoky incense haze catching light beams, backdrop of deep indigo velvet. Close-up, immaculate cable routing, tactile materials, no screens, no text.
