A small marble room with four facing mirrors; a single lantern is placed and moved until its infinite corridor aligns perfectly to pass through itself. When it settles, the reflections stop drifting: the scene finds a fixed point. Dust motes hang like stars; faint chalk on the floor suggests a functionâ€™s graph touching the diagonal. Quiet, exact, numinous.
