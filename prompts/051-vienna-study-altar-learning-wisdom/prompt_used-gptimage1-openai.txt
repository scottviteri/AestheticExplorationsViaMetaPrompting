Quiet, altar-like study in warm oak, lit by late-afternoon Vienna light through a simple Secession-style stained-glass arch window in amber and cobalt. At the center, a small round obsidian mirror framed by a silver serpent biting its tail, set behind a single beeswax candle; the flame reflects in the mirror at the same spot, a calm fixed point. To the left, a green slate resting on the desk shows a chalk drawing: one smooth white curve crossing a horizontal line once, clean and simple, no words. To the right, a clear prism turns one pale blue beam into many fine luminous threads that arc toward open blank notebooks and a pair of carved wooden hands used as bookends, passing a folded paper crane between themâ€”gentle guidance, empathy, collaboration. In the foreground, a brass balance holds a feather and a small river stone, poised; beside it, a spiral fern frond unfurls from a clay pot, with a seashell and a simple brass compass on linen. Delicate ribbons of light braid between the notebooks like traveling beads, hinting at growing bandwidth and learning. A faint frosted-glass halo behind the mirror shows subtle concentric rings. Soft dust motes, polished wood reflections.
