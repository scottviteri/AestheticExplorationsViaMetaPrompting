At the center of a dark stone chamber, a shallow mirror well reflects a single suspended lantern. Around the well, concentric rings of framed mirrors tilt incrementally so that a particular ray path lands back on the lantern itselfâ€”a visible fixed point in light. Dust motes and incense haze reveal the returning path; goldleaf accents; contemplative mood.
