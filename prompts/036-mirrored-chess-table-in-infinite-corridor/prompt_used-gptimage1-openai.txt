An elegant corridor with mirror-paneled walls on both sides creates deep, repeating reflections. At the center stands a small antique chess table with a polished black-and-white marble board; pieces are two contrasting materials: warm hammered copper versus frosted glass. From the left, a human hand in a dark sleeve reaches to move a knight; from the right, a translucent robotic hand with soft internal LEDs mirrors the gesture across the table. The checkered floor echoes the board and cascades into the reflections. Overhead, brass-framed lanterns glow, their light multiplying into the distance; a fine haze adds gentle volumetric beams. Composition: centered, eye-level, 50mm lens, cinematic wide aspect, shallow depth of field that keeps the table and first rings of reflections sharp, with creamy bokeh farther back. Materials: antique wood, brass, glass, marble. Palette: warm golds balanced by cool desaturated blues.
