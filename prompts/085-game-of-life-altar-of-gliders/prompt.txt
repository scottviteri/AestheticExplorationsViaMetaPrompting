A black marble altar etched with a subtle square grid. Tiny pearl lights embedded at some squares pulse in discrete steps; glider-like patterns drift diagonally, collide, and spawn oscillators that ring brass chimes. Long-exposure traces show emergent structure; candlelight, incense haze, crisp macro on inlays.
