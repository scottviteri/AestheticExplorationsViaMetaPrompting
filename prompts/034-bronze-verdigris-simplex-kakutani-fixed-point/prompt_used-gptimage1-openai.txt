Kakutani fixed point as altar object: a patinated bronze equilateral triangle frame (simplex) centered on a black stone plinth. Along each edge, a few branching opaline-glass filaments (set-valued correspondences) descend inward, their tips gently converging toward the interior. Suspended at the centroid is a small opaline–mirror bead that reflects the triangle and itself, appearing unchanged under the surrounding correspondences—a visible fixed point. Copper–Verdigris palette with opal accents; cathedral side-light and faint volumetric rays; delicate rim highlights and soft shadow falloff. One tangible hero subject; no readable text or equations., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
