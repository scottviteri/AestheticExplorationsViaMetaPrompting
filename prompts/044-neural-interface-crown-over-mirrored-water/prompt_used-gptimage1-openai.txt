A minimal temple-laboratory in white stone and brushed metal. At its center, a polished black mirror-pool; above it, a delicate neural interface crown—slender silver circlet with dozens of hair-thin microfilament petals—suspended by invisible threads. The filaments just kiss the water, sending concentric ripples that catch a ring of light orbiting the crown like an ouroboros made of photons. Overhead, a round oculus shows twilight; fiber-optic vines rise toward it, carrying tiny pulses of teal and gold, bandwidth made visible. Reflections of a calm human silhouette ripple in the pool, hinting at connection. Clean, serene, clinical-sacred lighting; soft fog; macro detail on metal and water; no text, no logos, no watermark., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
