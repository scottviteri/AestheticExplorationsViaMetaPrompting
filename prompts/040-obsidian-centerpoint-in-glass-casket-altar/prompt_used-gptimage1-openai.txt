A small glass casket with gilded corners rests on a walnut altar. Suspended at its exact center is a polished obsidian teardrop held by nearly invisible threads. Thin mirrored rings inside the casket all point toward the droplet; candlelight flickers around, but the dark center remains optically still. Velvet pads, a single tarnished silver key, and pale feathers sit around the base. Palette: smoked amber, black glass, antique gold. Close-up, 85mm lens, shallow depth emphasizing the droplet. Mood: intimate, introspective; undertone of self-discovery. Vibe: Fixed-point reliquary. No inscriptions or lettering., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
