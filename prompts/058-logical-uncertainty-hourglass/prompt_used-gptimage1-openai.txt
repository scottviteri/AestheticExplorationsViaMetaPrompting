An hourglass reliquary with two chambers. In the upper chamber, pearl-like beads labeled only by subtle surface patterns swirl chaotically; in the lower chamber, as beads pass the throat, they settle into concentric orbits on a turntable, brightness indicating stabilized credence. A ring of faint mirrored tabs around the throat reflects cycles of re-evaluation. Obsidian base; candlelight and moonbeam cross-lighting., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
