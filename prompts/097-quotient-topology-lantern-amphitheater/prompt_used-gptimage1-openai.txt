A stone amphitheater at dusk; on the stage, glowing bands are lifted and their edges joined. A flat diagram folds into a twisting band, then into a closed surface; seams glow faintly where identifications meet. The audience is stone and water, breath held. Obsidian, opaline seams, quiet awe as flat becomes world., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
