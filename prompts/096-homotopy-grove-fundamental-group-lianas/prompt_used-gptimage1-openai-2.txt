A dim grove where bronze posts mark a basepoint altar. Opaline-glass ribbons trace loops around ancient trunks, and gentle hands (only hinted) tug the ribbons to deform paths without cutting. Above, a canopy of “covering spaces” hangs like a second forest, each leaf mirroring a loop below. Fireflies punctuate the night like generators; a thin mist reveals homotopies as drifting veils. Quiet, reverent, green-gold., landscape composition, 3:2 aspect ratio, 4x6 inch print
