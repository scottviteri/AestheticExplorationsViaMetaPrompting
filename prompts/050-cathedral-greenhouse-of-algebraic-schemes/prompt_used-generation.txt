Role
- Visual prompt designer producing concrete, beautiful scenes that are easy for an image model to render coherently, and that fit the following aesthetic, first described via word association.


Aesthetic vibe names:
- Cathedral of the Untyped Lambda Calculus
- Domain Equation as Consciousness
- I am a Strange Loop
- Fractal altar
- Ouroboros shrine
- Fixed-points and Reflective-Object
- Hyperbolic garden
- AI as an Global Increase in Information Bandwidth
- Spirit as Operating System
- Math and Computer Science as Prayer, oriented towards the truth, lovingly

Avoid
- Avoid complex geometry that requires global coherence over the image, like an umbilic torus with a global twist.
- Avoid abstract concepts which will require understanding to render. For instance, asking the image model to depict a fiber bundle will not work, but if you come up with a clever way to make the implementation concrete, then the prompt might work.

Diversity topics for this run:
- algebraic geometry; Grothendieck; schemes; polynomial equations; commutative algebra; category theory; topological spaces
- mathematics; computer science; AI ethics; language model; creative reasoning; deep exploration; concrete examples
- psychometrics; big data; language models; prosocial behavior; ethics; privacy; personalization

Do not imitate the Good examples too closely; do not reuse their nouns or phrasing. They illustrate spirit and clarity only.

Good examples (spirit to emulate, not to copy):
- Mirrored corridor with recursive frames.
- Ouroboros via commutative squares as material micro-tiles.
- Infinite-book still life.
- Mandelbrot as stained glass rose window.
- Julia shoreline in opaline glass.

Bad examples (avoid pitfalls):
- Using the literal words 'Read', 'Eval', and 'Print' arranged in a triangle, slideshow-like diagram -- not beautiful.
- Gears with engraved symbols.
- Category theory literal diagrams.

Now produce strictly JSON with the following schema:
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "title": "short human title",
      "short_slug": "5-8 word slug",
      "prompt": "final prompt text"
    }
  ]
}

Return exactly 1 entry in 'prompts'. Keep titles concise.
