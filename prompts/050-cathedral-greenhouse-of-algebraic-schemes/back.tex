Symmetric, wide-angle view down the nave of a twilight cathedral-greenhouse library. Soaring Gothic arches in aged stone and wrought iron, warm golden-hour beams with soft mist. Stained glass windows show simple conic curves and polynomial rosettes in opaline colors. At center, a low stone altar becomes a potting bench: a small bronze serpent biting its tail encircles a polished silver sphere; two slender mirrors face each other with a single candle between them, reflections receding to infinity. From a delicate brass fountain shaped like a branching tree, dozens of hair-thin fiber-optic filaments carry soft streams of colored light speckled with tiny glyph-like sparks into a ring of white porcelain bowls; each bowl wears a frosted lid with a subtle keyhole shape and a gentle inner glow. A brass balance scale beside them glows faintly, weighing light. Along the aisles, terracotta planters hold crocheted coral and fern-like forms curling in gentle hyperbolic ruffles, dewdrops catching light. Railings are draped with a hand-stitched patchwork quilt of many fabrics—linen, velvet, denim—overlapping patches with visible seams and tiny brass ring pins, evoking local pieces glued into a whole. Tall chalkboards lean against pillars with a few large, clean white equations: x\textasciicircum{}2 + y\textasciicircum{}2 = 1; xy = 0; y\textasciicircum{}2 = x\textasciicircum{}3 − x. Chalk dust motes sparkle in the rays. Shelves of apothecary jars are packed with folded paper slips; some glass clear, some frosted for privacy, each jar tied with a different colored ribbon for personalization. Between columns hang thin silk banners with subtle circuit-like embroidery, translucent and gently backlit, suggesting spirit as operating system. The floor is a mosaic of earthen tiles arranged like garden plots and narrow channels; tiny pulses of light flow through the channels toward each planter, hinting at a global increase in information bandwidth. No people. Cinematic, photorealistic, ultra-detailed materials (stone, brass, porcelain, glass, moss, fabric), centered composition, 35mm wide-angle, soft depth of field, volumetric god rays, fine dust, rich natural palette of moss green, weathered stone, brass gold, opaline white, deep indigo.
