At blue hour inside a vaulted hall that feels like a cathedral of computation: dark basalt floors, warm oak benches, and brushed‑aluminum ribs. Slender arches woven from fiber‑optic bundles rise overhead, their cyan pulses traveling like breath. Center frame: a low altar of polished obsidian with a subtle recursive inlay; on it rests a shallow bowl of mercury‑like liquid acting as a calm mirror. Encircling the bowl, a thin copper ouroboros is etched as a circuit trace. From the altar radiate clear glass pipes and copper rails like an organ: tiny teal and amber beads glide through them, splitting and merging at clean fork and join nodes—tangible combinators and mobile processes. Some pipe segments glide along magnetic tracks and re‑dock elsewhere, suggesting channels that move; brass sockets pair and unpair like interaction rules. A few rails loop back into the same node, hinting at fixed points and looping logic. Suspended in the nave, transparent panes behave like quiet terminals: soft monochrome panes with faint, illegible code‑like glyphs, connected by real glass pipes that “pipe” the glowing beads between panels, plus minimal play/pause/check icons for command execution and user interaction—no readable text. A handful of panes are veiled with translucent scrims, implying consent and privacy. Bordering the aisle, a hyperbolic garden of pale succulents and moss forms rippling lace‑like beds, dotted with tiny LED votives. Under each arch, micro‑lamps tick in gentle binary rhythm; volumetric rays mix warm amber candlelight with cool cyan fiber‑light, with lavender edge glints on the mirror bowl. In the air, small cursor‑like arrows and punctuation shapes drift like fireflies, hinting at language and questioning. Materials are tactile—glass, copper, oak, basalt, brass—with micro‑scratches and dust motes visible in the light. Cinematic, serene, central perspective, 50mm lens, high detail, gentle haze; mathematics and computer science rendered as a quiet devotion, lovingly oriented toward truth.
