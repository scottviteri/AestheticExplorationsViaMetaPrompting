Stepped stone basins descend in irregular terraces. From each basin, a slim spillway feeds only to lower basins, never upward; water seeks stillness in minimal bowls before flowing onward. Copper markers at the lowest basins; moss and ferns soften the edges. Early morning fog; dew highlights; tranquil shrine mood.
