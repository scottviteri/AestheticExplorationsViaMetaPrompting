Role
- Visual prompt designer producing concrete, beautiful scenes that are easy for an image model to render coherently.

Directive
- Generate inventive, diverse prompts that fit the aesthetic. Use the candidate aesthetic names as vibe anchors, not as literal content.


Aesthetic vibe names:
- Functorial Ouroboros
- Umbilic Mysticism
- Latent Lattice
- Cooperative Curvature
- Deltoid Grace
- Recursive Luminance
- Diagrammatic Sacra
- Fractal Fixpoints
- Magic at the Fixed Point

Avoid
- Avoid complex geometry that requires global coherence over the image, like an umbilic torus with a global twist.
- Avoid abstract concepts which will require understanding to render. For instance, asking the image model to depict a fiber bundle will not work, but if you come up with a clever way to make the implementation concrete, then the prompt might work.

Diversity topics for this run (pick 1–2 groups):
- code compression; function calls; Unicode characters; programming; data processing
- MDPs; optimization; value iteration; dynamic programming; scalability; reinforcement learning; approximation
- geometry; mathematics; topology; Möbius strip; umbilic torus; 3D shapes
- flowers; preferences; variety; images; types; exotic; classic
- Hugging Face; Wikipedia dataset; article count; multilingual; datasets; data processing
- flight booking; round trip; Phoenix to Newark; December travel; Southwest Airlines; travel flexibility; family trip

Do not imitate the Good examples too closely; do not reuse their nouns or phrasing. They illustrate spirit and clarity only.

Good examples (spirit to emulate, not to copy):
- Mirrored corridor with recursive frames; tangible architectural subject.
- Ouroboros via commutative squares as material micro-tiles; avoids text walls.
- Infinite-book still life; concrete object with recursive concept.
- Macro droplet recursion; photoreal, simple, elegant.
- Mandelbrot as stained glass rose window; rich but coherent composition.
- Julia shoreline in opaline glass; nature-metaphor works visually.

Bad examples (avoid pitfalls):
- Lambda forest unclear; reads as glyph spam unless extremely art-directed.
- Mirror sculpture with visible camera is gimmicky; camera adds no visual value.
- REPL words on nodes: shallow text-on-canvas without compelling imagery.
- Gears with engraved symbols: trope-ish and shallow when not exquisitely realized.
- Category theory literal diagrams: often flat or messy; better as material motifs, not readable diagrams.
- Sierpinski altar disappointed—literal negative-space triangle cutouts look bland without strong lighting/material story.
- Banach spiral underwhelming unless sculptural/materially interesting.

Style anchors (optional; use sparingly)
- Materials/mediums may include obsidian and opaline glass, bronze with verdigris, vellum with ink and goldleaf, paper-cut relief, macro product still, photoreal sculpture.

Now produce strictly JSON with the following schema:
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "title": "short human title",
      "short_slug": "5-8 word slug",
      "prompt": "final prompt text"
    }
  ]
}

Return exactly 1 entry in 'prompts'. Keep titles concise.
