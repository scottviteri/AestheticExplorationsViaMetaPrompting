Macro product still life on a polished obsidian slab: a compact brass micro‑press sits center, its rollers gently pulling a translucent copper‑iridescent ribbon that’s micro‑engraved with assorted Unicode glyphs. On the left, the ribbon enters as a loose coil; on the right, it emerges as a tightly wound, smaller spool—clear, tactile metaphor for code compression and data processing. Beside it, three nested opaline‑glass boxes (large, medium, small) are aligned in a quiet arc; each contains a proportionally smaller coil of the same ribbon, softly glowing to suggest recursive function calls without text. Warm top key light and cool edge rim create a delicate lattice of reflections and caustics across the glass and stone. Materials: brushed brass with subtle verdigris in creases, opaline glass with milk‑white bloom, copper film with holographic sheen. Background fades to charcoal with gentle bokeh; clean studio composition, high detail, shallow depth of field, 85mm, f/2.8. No readable words—glyphs remain tiny and ornamental.
