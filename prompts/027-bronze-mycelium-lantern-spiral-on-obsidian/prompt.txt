Single hero subject: a bronze mycelium lantern sculpture on a polished obsidian plinth; branching hyphae with verdigris patina weave into a gentle spiral, surfaces smooth and tactile. At the tips, opaline glass spore-lanterns with milky translucence glow softly; inside each lantern, a tiny bronze lattice repeats the larger network, a quiet recursive echo. Cathedral side-light with rim highlights and thin volumetric mist like a breath tracing the paths; faint fiber-optic glints suggest slow pulses along the branches. Obsidian–Opal palette with restrained Copper–Verdigris accents; generous dark negative space; studio still-life composition. Photoreal materials, micro-scratches and patina, soft caustic reflections, shallow depth of field; serene, nature-wise, Miyazaki-adjacent spirit.
