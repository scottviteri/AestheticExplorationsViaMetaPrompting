A quiet tokonoma alcove: plaster walls, cedar lintel, tatami floor. At center, a small bronze bell on a black lacquer stand is encircled by a meticulously wound copper telegraph coil, forming a wreath; pale ceramic insulators glow like beads. Two folded, unprinted washi streamers hang symmetrically. A dim oil lamp to one side casts golden reflections along the copper and a soft shadow halo behind the bell. Minimal props; balanced, ritual symmetry; intimate close-up; calm, reverent mood; patina, frayed fiber, fine dust. No writing or logos.
