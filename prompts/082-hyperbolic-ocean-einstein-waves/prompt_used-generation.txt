Ok, this time I will ask to create prompts in a bit of a different way.
I am just going to look through the images we have so far and point out some themes that I would like to see more of.

I like things that are fractal related and I want to see more raw fractal texture, like one might see in a video of traveling through a mandlebulb universe
Visualizations of alien universes with different physics where those differences can be described mathematically but it is up to you (or the image model) to visualize given that description 
Game of life aesthetics -- gliders and building complexity from simplicity
I liked the chladni plate-like patterns of watter in the graph laplacian water harp prompt, and I would love to see more interesting spectral dynamics and arrangements of water physics 
More various different kinds of curious mathematical famous objects that are amenable to visualization -- such as those listed on the page @https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topologies 
  (eg sierpinski carpet triangle cantor koch snowflake menger sponge hawaiian earing space-filling curves, and creative mixtures therein
I love the gradiousity and alienness of deep space and the surprises that we cannot comprehent

Please add the prompts to folders, as before. Your help is truly appreciated, and I will credit you in the results of this work.
