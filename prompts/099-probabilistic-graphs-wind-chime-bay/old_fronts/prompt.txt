Slender bronze masts over quiet water hold wind-chimes arranged as a directed acyclic graph. Each nodeâ€™s chime is tuned to the conditional; breeze passing one influences downstream harmonics, while leaves at the roots ring on their own. Thin opaline threads indicate flow, and dusk light paints soft gradients across the bay. A music of dependencies.
