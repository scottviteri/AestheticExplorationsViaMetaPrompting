A twilight greenhouse-cathedral nave, symmetrical and serene, where algebraic geometry becomes a living sanctuary. A central aisle leads to a stepped stone altar composed of repeating smaller altars, a quiet fractal. Atop it, a circular ivy wreath encloses a shallow mirror of water; its reflection echoes the arches above into an infinite loop, an organic ouroboros shrine. Flanking the aisle, trellised saplings are trained into tidy rectangular frames. Inside each frame hang overlapping translucent leaf-panels in soft jade and fog-blue, subtly suggesting open covers. Fine etchings in the glass show graceful polynomial curve motifs—parabolas, nodal cubics, lemniscate-like loops—pure geometry without any text. The floor is a mosaic of ceramic tiles with inlaid rings and flowing curve insets. Along the aisle, crystal bell-jars shelter small luminous seed-stones with branching hairline fractures, glowing like spectral blossoms. Planters cradle ruffled succulents with radially pleated rosettes—an understated hyperbolic garden touch. High overhead, opaline oculi and slim brass latticework bathe the space in pearly, volumetric light. Materials: polished limestone, verdigris copper, frosted glass, living moss. Color palette: emerald, ivory, pale gold, teal. Composition: centered, wide-angle 24mm, f/8, sharp micro-detail, soft mist, floating dust motes. Mood: contemplative, math-as-prayer, no text, no literal diagrams, coherent forms.
