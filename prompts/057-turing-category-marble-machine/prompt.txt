A marble-run altar of dark walnut and brass. Arrow-shaped chutes compose into larger routes; reversible switches send marbles back into earlier modules to suggest recursion. A polished mirror behind folds the machine into a corridor of self-composition. Studio light; high macro detail on joinery and bearings; crisp motion implied.
