An outdoor cloister where stone paths (premises) flow through archways (rules) into a central fountain (conclusion). Some paths join; others split; a few loops return elegantlyâ€”composition as a walkable proof. Subtle engraved icons on paving stones evoke natural deduction vs. sequent steps without text. Golden hour light; ivy and water sparkle.
