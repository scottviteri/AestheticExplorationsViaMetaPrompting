Night in a quiet desert hollow where wind-carved sandstone forms a broad, stepped basin. The terraces descend in smooth, gently curved levels toward a circular pool that glows with cool blue light. A line of flat stone plates marks a deliberate path from rim to center like measured footfalls. Along each terrace edge, small glass spheres are placed at even intervals, catching moonlight as bright pinpoints. Tiny clay cups with flames dot the steps; wisps of smoke reveal soft air currents. The scene reads as a sacred place of guidance and descent. Camera: elevated three-quarter view, 35mm lens, moonlit realism, long-exposure feel. Lighting: cool lunar blues on stone, warm amber accents from the flames, subtle volumetrics. High-detail sand grains, stratified rock textures, calm water with faint ripples.
