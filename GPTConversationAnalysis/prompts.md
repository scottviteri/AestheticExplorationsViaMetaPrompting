## Prompt Library for “Functorial Ouroboros” Aesthetic

Use, remix, or stack prompts. Keep symbol text sparse. Add camera or renderer notes as needed (macro, tilt-shift, long exposure, volumetric light, subsurface scattering, global illumination).

### Prompt anatomy (template)
“[subject], [form/material], [composition], [lighting], [palette], [surface/texture], [motion cue], [style/medium]. Optional: [environment/context], [camera], [render notes].”

Examples of add-ons: “macro lens bokeh”, “cathedral side-light”, “fiber optic glow”, “rim light on edges”, “octane/arnold-style path tracing”, “8k”.
