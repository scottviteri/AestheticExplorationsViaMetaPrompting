## Naming and Inference of Aesthetics (for Prompt Design)

### Candidate names for the aesthetic
- Functorial Ouroboros
- Umbilic Mysticism
- Latent Lattice
- Cooperative Curvature
- Deltoid Grace
- Recursive Luminance
- Diagrammatic Sacra
- Fractal Fixpoints
- Magic at the Fixed Point

### Pillars (what makes it feel right)
- **Recursive sacred geometry**: toroidal and deltoid forms; self-similarity; mirrors within mirrors.
- **Diagrammatic mysticism**: commutative squares, natural transformations, functors; diagrams presented as devotional objects.
- **Prosocial techno-animism**: alignment as nurture; humane technology; communal intelligence.
- **Liminal continuity**: phase transitions, boundaries-as-thresholds, discontinuity/continuity interplay.
- **Embodied reflection**: dance, circling, breath-like flow; experience in the moment.
- **Wisdom pacing**: capability versus wisdom; temperance, restraint, stewardship.
- **Natural abstractions**: information geometry, manifold intuition, Clifford blades/rotors.
- **Fractal recursion and fixed points**: self-similarity across scales; μ/ν fixed points as visual anchors; infinite-zoom vibes where math meets magic.

### Motif lexicon
- Umbilic torus (deltoid cross-section rotating ~60° along its path)
- Ouroboros, REPL loops, fixed-point Y, λ-calculus flourishes
- Commuting diagrams, string diagrams, braided morphisms
- Lattices (⊓, ⊔), posets, Hasse diagrams, phase spaces
- Fiber bundles, atlases, charts, local-to-global gluing
- Information-geometric manifolds, geodesic flows, Fisher metric heatmaps
- Clifford algebra blades, bivector fields, rotors
- Poincaré/conformal grids; hyperbolic tilings
- Fractals: Mandelbrot/Julia sets, iterated function systems (IFS), L-systems, self-similar tilings
- Authentic-relating circles; partner dancing arcs and holds

### Materials and textures
- Polished obsidian, black marble veined with opal
- Bronze, copper, patinated verdigris
- Vellum/parchment with ink; gold leaf accents
- Holographic film, fiber optics; etched glass
- Silk, satin, velvet; paper cut filigree

### Color palettes (guides; mix and match)
- Obsidian–Opal: #0b0b10, #2a2f3a, #59e1e1, #e0f0ff
- Indigo–Goldleaf: #0e1633, #1f2a6a, #d6b25e, #fff3c9
- Copper–Verdigris: #7a3b1a, #c46a3d, #2c6e6e, #9ad7c6
- Rose–Teal Lattice: #f0d5d8, #b45c6e, #2aa3a0, #103d3d
- Graphite Mono with Accent: #0e0e0e, #2b2b2b, #747474, accent #ffd166

### Composition patterns
- Concentric recursion: nested frames/portals; “image inside itself” vortices
- Toroidal corridors: walkable rings with moving deltoid ribs
- Commuting grids: 2×2 and 3×3 squares with morphisms as glowing paths
- Bundle-and-section: base manifold under a hovering fiber with projection shafts
- Flow fields: vector textures guiding gaze; divergence/curl contrasts
- Fractal layouts: Sierpinski-like negative space, self-similar partitions, spiral recursions, infinite-zoom compositions

### Motion cues (for still images rendered as dynamic)
- Slow spirals; cyclical breath-like expansions
- Morphing topology: deltoid cross-section rotating along a torus
- Phase-change textures: matte→glossy transitions across boundaries
- Attention heatmaps blooming across surfaces
- Infinite zoom illusions; scale-recursive transitions (macro→micro echoes)

### Symbolic/typographic hints (use sparingly)
- λ, Y, ∘, ⇒, ⊢, ⊣, ⊓, ⊔, ⟂, ⊤, Hom(–,–)
- Arrow glyphs as light traces; braided wires as monoidal products
- μ and ν for least/greatest fixed points; “fix f” or “Fix(f)” motifs in tiny inscriptions

### Mood words
Serene, contemplative, reverent, lucid, cooperative, recursive, luminous, patient, embodied, attuned.

### From pillars to prompt levers
- **Subject**: pick a geometric/diagrammatic anchor (umbilic torus, commuting square, fiber bundle).
- **Material**: choose 1–2 (obsidian+opal, bronze+verdigris, vellum+goldleaf).
- **Lighting**: devotional/cathedral, caustics on polished surfaces, rim light on edges.
- **Palette**: select one of the palettes; keep accent restrained.
- **Composition**: concentric recursion or grid of morphisms; include a self-referential frame when apt.
- **Motion cue**: mention spiral breath, rotating deltoid, or blooming attention.
- **Symbol density**: light touch—one or two symbols only.
- **Human element** (optional): dancers/circlers as curves; hands that hold diagrams.

### Negative-space and negative prompts (optional)
- Avoid clutter; prefer generous dark fields.
- Keep text minimal to avoid render artifacts; hint symbols rather than long formulas.
- Avoid kitsch/fantasy tropes unless deliberately subverted.
